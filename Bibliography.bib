	shorttitle = {Toward machine emotional intelligence},
	abstract = {ÐThe ability to recognize emotion is one of the hallmarks of emotional intelligence, an aspect of human intelligence that has been argued to be even more important than mathematical and verbal intelligences. This paper proposes that machine intelligence needs to include emotional intelligence and demonstrates results toward this goal: developing a machine's ability to recognize human affective state given four physiological signals. We describe difficult issues unique to obtaining reliable affective data and collect a large set of data from a subject trying to elicit and experience each of eight emotional states, daily, over multiple weeks. This paper presents and compares multiple algorithms for feature-based recognition of emotional state from this data. We analyze four physiological signals that exhibit problematic day-to-day variations: The features of different emotions on the same day tend to cluster more tightly than do the features of the same emotion on different days. To handle the daily variations, we propose new features and algorithms and compare their performance. We find that the technique of seeding a Fisher Projection with the results of Sequential Floating Forward Search improves the performance of the Fisher Projection and provides the highest recognition rates reported to date for classification of affect from physiology: 81 percent recognition accuracy on eight classes of emotion, including neutral.},

	abstract = {A physiological signal-based emotion recognition system is reported. The system was developed to operate as a user-independent system, based on physiological signal databases obtained from multiple subjects. The input signals were electrocardiogram, skin temperature variation and electrodermal activity, all of which were acquired without much discomfort from the body surface, and can reﬂect the inﬂuence of emotion on the autonomic nervous system. The system consisted of preprocessing, feature extraction and pattern classiﬁcation stages. Preprocessing and feature extraction methods were devised so that emotion-speciﬁc characteristics could be extracted from short-segment signals. Although the features were carefully extracted, their distribution formed a classiﬁcation problem, with large overlap among clusters and large variance within clusters. A support vector machine was adopted as a pattern classiﬁer to resolve this difﬁculty. Correct-classiﬁcation ratios for 50 subjects were 78.4\% and 61.8\%, for the recognition of three and four categories, respectively.},

	abstract = {The {QRS} complex is a name for the combination of three of the graphical deflections seen on a typical electrocardiogram ({EKG} or {ECG}). It is usually the central and most visually obvious part of the tracing; in other words, it's the main spike seen on an {ECG} line. It corresponds to the depolarization of the right and left ventricles of the human heart and contraction of the large ventricular muscles. 
	In adults, the {QRS} complex normally lasts 0.06–0.10 s; in children and during physical activity, it may be shorter. The Q, R, and S waves occur in rapid succession, do not all appear in all leads, and reflect a single event and thus are usually considered together. A Q wave is any downward deflection immediately following the P wave. An R wave follows as an upward deflection, and the S wave is any downward deflection after the R wave. The T wave follows the S wave, and in some cases, an additional U wave follows the T wave.},
