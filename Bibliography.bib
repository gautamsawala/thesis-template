	abstract = {ÐThe ability to recognize emotion is one of the hallmarks of emotional intelligence, an aspect of human intelligence that has been argued to be even more important than mathematical and verbal intelligences. This paper proposes that machine intelligence needs to include emotional intelligence and demonstrates results toward this goal: developing a machine's ability to recognize human affective state given four physiological signals. We describe difficult issues unique to obtaining reliable affective data and collect a large set of data from a subject trying to elicit and experience each of eight emotional states, daily, over multiple weeks. This paper presents and compares multiple algorithms for feature-based recognition of emotional state from this data. We analyze four physiological signals that exhibit problematic day-to-day variations: The features of different emotions on the same day tend to cluster more tightly than do the features of the same emotion on different days. To handle the daily variations, we propose new features and algorithms and compare their performance. We find that the technique of seeding a Fisher Projection with the results of Sequential Floating Forward Search improves the performance of the Fisher Projection and provides the highest recognition rates reported to date for classification of affect from physiology: 81 percent recognition accuracy on eight classes of emotion, including neutral.},

The system was developed to operate as a user-independent system, based on physiological signal databases obtained from multiple subjects. The input signals were electrocardiogram, skin temperature variation and electrodermal activity, all of which were acquired without much discomfort from the body surface, and can reﬂect the inﬂuence of emotion on the autonomic nervous system. The system consisted of preprocessing, feature extraction and pattern classiﬁcation stages. Preprocessing and feature extraction methods were devised so that emotion-speciﬁc characteristics could be extracted from short-segment signals. Although the features were carefully extracted, their distribution formed a classiﬁcation problem, with large overlap among clusters and large variance within clusters. A support vector machine was adopted as a pattern classiﬁer to resolve this difﬁculty. Correct-classiﬁcation ratios for 50 subjects were 78.4\% and 61.8\%, for the recognition of three and four categories, respectively.},

	abstract = {The {QRS} complex is a name for the combination of three of the graphical deflections seen on a typical electrocardiogram ({EKG} or {ECG}). It is usually the central and most visually obvious part of the tracing; in other words, it's the main spike seen on an {ECG} line. It corresponds to the depolarization of the right and left ventricles of the human heart and contraction of the large ventricular muscles. 
	In adults, the {QRS} complex normally lasts 0.06–0.10 s; in children and during physical activity, it may be shorter. The Q, R, and S waves occur in rapid succession, do not all appear in all leads, and reflect a single event and thus are usually considered together. A Q wave is any downward deflection immediately following the P wave. An R wave follows as an upward deflection, and the S wave is any downward deflection after the R wave. The T wave follows the S wave, and in some cases, an additional U wave follows the T wave.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Wearable devices are currently at the heart of just about every discussion related to the Internet of Things. The requirement for self-health monitoring and preventive medicine is increasing due to the projected dramatic increase in the number of elderly people until 2020. Developed technologies are truly able to reduce the overall costs for prevention and monitoring. This is possible by constantly monitoring health indicators in various areas, and in particular, wearable devices are considered to carry this task out. These wearable devices and mobile apps now have been integrated with telemedicine and telehealth efficiently, to structure the medical Internet of Things. This paper reviews wearable health care devices both in scientific papers and commercial efforts. Methods: MIoT is demonstrated through a defined architecture design, including hardware and software dealing with wearable devices, sensors, smart phones, medical application, and medical station analyzers for further diagnosis and data storage. Results: Wearables, with the help of improved technology have been developed greatly and are considered reliable tools for long-term health monitoring systems. These are applied in the observation of a large variety of health monitoring indicators in the environment, vital signs, and fitness. Conclusions: Wearable devices are now used for a wide range of healthcare observation. One of the most important elements essential in data collection is the sensor. During recent years with improvement in semiconductor technology, sensors have made investigation of a full range of parameters closer to realization.},

The present research seeks deeper insights into these intrinsically motivating mechanisms by investigating neurophysiological correlates of cognitive absorption in the context of enactive learning, specifically simulation-based training on the use of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. An experiment was conducted in which 36 student trainees used ERP software to make decisions while running a simulated company. Consistent with flow theory, skill, difficulty, and their interaction significantly influenced cognitive absorption (R2=.16). Five neurophysiological measures were captured for each trainee: EEG alpha, EEG beta, electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate, and heart rate variability. Each of the five neurophysiological measures explained significant unique variance in cognitive absorption over and above skill, difficulty, and their interaction, and collectively more than doubled the explained variance to R2=.34. Overall, cognitive absorption was positively related to a more relaxed, less vigilant state. Cognitive absorption was significantly related to the training outcome. These findings provide new insights into the psychological states that are conducive to experiencing cognitive absorption during enactive training.},

	doi = {10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591456},
	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is diagnosed by analysis of the morphological and rhythmic properties of the electrocardiogram. It was recently shown that accurate detection of AFib is possible using beat-to-beat interval variations. This raises the question of whether AFib detection can be performed using a pulsatile waveform such as the Photoplethysmogram (PPG). The recent explosion in use of recreational and professional ambulatory wrist-based pulse monitoring devices means that an accurate pulse-based AFib screening algorithm would enable large scale screening for silent or undiagnosed AFib, a significant risk factor for multiple diseases. We propose a noise-resistant machine learning approach to detecting AFib from noisy ambulatory PPG recorded from the wrist using a modern research watch-based wearable device (the Samsung Simband). Ambulatory pulsatile and movement data were recorded from 46 subjects, 15 with AFib and 31 non symptomatic. Single channel electrocardiogram (ECG), multi-wavelength PPG and tri-axial accelerometry were recorded simultaneously at 128 Hz from the non-dominant wrist using the Simband. Recording lengths varied from 3.5 to 8.5 minutes. Pulse (beat) detection was performed on the PPG waveforms, and eleven features were extracted based on beat-to-beat variability and waveform signal quality. Using 10-fold cross validation, an accuracy of 95 \% on out-of-sample data was achieved, with a sensitivity of 97\%, specificity of 94\%, and an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.99. The described approach provides a noise-resistant, accurate screening tool for AFib from PPG sensors located in an ambulatory wrist watch. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate an algorithm with a high enough accuracy to be used in general population studies that does not require an ambulatory Holter electrocardiographic monitor.},

	abstract = {Introduction: We aimed to evaluate whether a novel deep neural network (DNN) can predict cardiovascular risk factors from off-the-shelf wearables with a photoplethysmographic (PPG) heart rate sensor and accelerometer. Longitudinal heart rate variability and activity patterns have previously been associated with incident hypertension, diabetes, and sleep apnea, conditions which are frequently undiagnosed.Methods: Health eHeart, an IRB-approved UCSF study, enrolled 6,115 active users of the Cardiogram app for Apple Watch. Heart rate and step counts were collected for a period of 1 to 53 weeks (mean=8.9). Data from 70\% of participants (33,628 person-weeks of data) was used to train a semi-supervised, multi-task DNN with both convolutional and recurrent layers to simultaneously predict prevalent hypertension, sleep apnea, and diabetes. Test performance characteristics were estimated using the remaining 30\% of participants.Results: Mean age was 42.3 ± 12.1, 69\% male. 2,230 (36.5\%) of participants had hypertension, 1,016 (16.6\%) had sleep apnea, and 462 (7.6\%) had diabetes. In the validation set, the DNN outperformed a baseline logistic regression model incorporating age, sex, and beta blocker use, predicting prevalent hypertension with a c-statistic of 0.819 (95\% CI 0.76-0.88; with an optimal operating point yielding 84.8\% sensitivity and 63.6\% specificity) vs a baseline c-statistic of 0.682 (95\% CI 0.60-0.76), and prevalent sleep apnea with a c-statistic of 0.902 (95\% CI 0.85-0.95; with an optimal operating point yielding 90.4\% sensitivity and 59.8\% specificity) vs a baseline c-statistic of 0.459 (95\% CI 0.39-0.53). Results were not statistically significant for diabetes.Conclusions: Our DNN demonstrates surprisingly good prediction of hypertension and sleep apnea given that its only inputs are heart rate and step count. Whether such DNNs can provide durable and portable predictions for these conditions in other study samples is worth pursuing.Download figureDownload PowerPoint},

Research is able to measure brain movement and emotions to see how brain works. Conventional marketing tools have proven to be limited when testing human subjects and have frequently been criticized for their inability to assess consumers’ motivations. Although neuromarketing is gaining popularity among professionals and academicians, there are still reservations when it comes to the function of neuromarketing and its level of information accuracy. The emerging field of emotions as a physiological state in marketing has established itself as an important source for marketers and academic research. This article reviews the history of neuromarketing, describes its applications, depicts the challenges in its implementation, and hence explores potential elucidation to ensure effective uses that remain underexplored.},

As a strategic resource, Neuroscience brings a new perspective by allowing you to explore those difficult or verbally unconscious motives behind consumer behaviours. The present work aims to discover the relationship between the emotions induced in audiovisual advertising messages and their impact on the memory of the subjects. To achieve this goal, an experiment was carried out with eight audiovisual advertising messages (six representatives of the basic emotions: joy, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness, and two rational ones that show the technical specifications of the product). Neuromarketing techniques such as the electrical activity of the heart (ECG) and the electrodermal activity (EDA) of the subjects are used, on one hand; and, on the other, a conventional research technique, a questionnaire applied to the subjects that participated in the research. The results show variations in the measures performed in the commercials corresponding to joy, surprise and anger, while for both, remembrance of the message transmitted and activity of the advertiser, the commercial with the best results has been the one regarding sadness, advertisement that has also been considered the most attractive for participating subjects.},

	abstract = {Machine learning approaches for human emotion recognition have recently demonstrated high performance. However, only/mostly for subject-dependent approaches, in a variety of applications like advanced driver assisted systems, smart homes and medical environments. Therefore, now the focus is shifted more towards subject-independent approaches, which are more universal and where the emotion recognition system is trained using a speciﬁc group of subjects and then tested on totally new persons and thereby possibly while using other sensors of same physiological signals in order to recognize their emotions. In this paper, we explore a novel robust subject-independent human emotion recognition system, which consists of two major models. The ﬁrst one is an automatic feature calibration model and the second one is a classiﬁcation model based on Cellular Neural Networks (CNN). The proposed system produces state-of-the-art results with an accuracy rate between 80\% and 89\% when using the same elicitation materials and physiological sensors brands for both training and testing and an accuracy rate of 71.05\% when the elicitation materials and physiological sensors brands used in training are different from those used in training. Here, the following physiological signals are involved: ECG (Electrocardiogram), EDA (Electrodermal activity) and ST (Skin-Temperature).},

	abstract = {Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24 h, short-term ({\textasciitilde}5 min), and ultra-short-term ({\textless}5 min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from {\textasciitilde}2 min to 24 h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.},

This study quantifies the responsiveness and similarity with the finger of 16 different recording positions of skin conductance while watching emotional film fragments. Findings indicated foot, fingers and shoulders being most responsive, whereas arm, back, armpit, and thighbone were least responsive. The measurements at the foot were most similar with those of the finger. In contrast, arm, back, and armpit traces differed most from the finger trace. Taken together, foot and shoulders are the best alternatives to the finger for ambulatory measurement of skin conductance to reflect emotional arousal.

The present report compared multiple sites (fingers, abductor hallucis of the foot, arch of the foot, toes, forehead, and wrist) from 45 college student participants in a short-term sedentary laboratory setting and found large variation in both tonic and phasic SC responses, as well as crucial lapses in responding at nonpalmar sites. Across-site correlations between participants and within participants were also examined. The present data show that, in the laboratory setting employing commonly used recording techniques and stimuli, the nonpalmar sites are generally less responsive than the fingers, and the wrist in particular is the lowest in responding, whereas the toes are most similar to the fingers in responding. Within-participant correlations between the fingers and other sites were greatest for the plantar sites and least for the forehead.},

	abstract = {Electrodermal activity is characterized by the superposition of what appear to be single distinct skin conductance responses (SCRs). Classic trough-to-peak analysis of these responses is impeded by their apparent superposition. A deconvolution approach is proposed, which separates SC data into continuous signals of tonic and phasic activity. The resulting phasic activity shows a zero baseline, and overlapping SCRs are represented by predominantly distinct, compact impulses showing an average duration of less than 2 s. A time integration of the continuous measure of phasic activity is proposed as a straightforward indicator of event-related sympathetic activity. The quality and beneﬁt of the proposed measure is demonstrated in an experiment with short interstimulus intervals as well as by means of a simulation study. The advances compared to previous decomposition methods are discussed.},

The first reports of basal skin resistance (BSR) and stimulated skin resistance (GSR) change by Vigouroux and Fere, respectively, are related to their other research and that of other workers. Hermann's early work on the sudomotor system is seen as much more advanced than has been realized, providing a sound basis for theory which the French apparently never noticed. Several additional sources suggest that TarchanofE's work was performed with awareness of Fere's and was probably not an independent discovery.},

	abstract = {Little attention has been paid so far to physiological signals for emotion recognition compared to audiovisual emotion channels such as facial expression or speech. This paper investigates the potential of physiological signals as reliable channels for emotion recognition. All essential stages of an automatic recognition system are discussed, from the recording of a physiological data set to a feature-based multiclass classification. In order to collect a physiological data set from multiple subjects over many weeks, we used a musical induction method that spontaneously leads subjects to real emotional states, without any deliberate laboratory setting. Four-channel biosensors were used to measure electromyogram, electrocardiogram, skin conductivity, and respiration changes. A wide range of physiological features from various analysis domains, including time/frequency, entropy, geometric analysis, subband spectra, multiscale entropy, etc., is proposed in order to find the best emotion-relevant features and to correlate them with emotional states. The best features extracted are specified in detail and their effectiveness is proven by classification results. Classification of four musical emotions (positive/high arousal, negative/high arousal, negative/low arousal, and positive/low arousal) is performed by using an extended linear discriminant analysis (pLDA). Furthermore, by exploiting a dichotomic property of the 2D emotion model, we develop a novel scheme of emotion-specific multilevel dichotomous classification (EMDC) and compare its performance with direct multiclass classification using the pLDA. An improved recognition accuracy of 95 percent and 70 percent for subject-dependent and subject-independent classification, respectively, is achieved by using the EMDC scheme.},

Emotion recognition can be achieved by a number of methods, one of which is through the use of bio-sensors. Bio-sensors possess a number of advantages against other emotion recognition methods as they can be made both inobtrusive and robust against a number of environmental conditions which other forms of emotion recognition have difficulty to overcome. In this paper, we describe a procedure to train computers to recognise emotions using multiple signals from many different bio-sensors. In particular, we describe the procedure we adopted to elicit emotions and to train our system to recognise them. We also present a set of preliminary results which indicate that our neural net classifier is able to obtain accuracy rates of 96.6\% and 89.9\% for recognition of emotion arousal and valence respectively.},

Furthermore, speciﬁc psychological experiments were designed to induce properly stress on individuals in order to acquire a database for training, validating, and testing the proposed system. Such system is based on fuzzy logic, and it described the behavior of an individual under stressing stimuli in terms of HR and GSR. The stress-detection accuracy obtained is 99.5\% by acquiring HR and GSR during a period of 10 s, and what is more, rates over 90\% of success are achieved by decreasing that acquisition period to 3–5 s. Finally, this paper comes up with a proposal that an accurate stress detection only requires two physiological signals, namely, HR and GSR, and the fact that the proposed stress-detection system is suitable for real-time applications.},

This secondary mode of interactive communication is hypothesized to permit a more natural collaboration, similar to the “body language” interaction between two cooperating humans. This paper describes the implementation and validation of a hidden Markov model (HMM) for estimating human affective state in real time, using robot motions as the stimulus. Inputs to the system are physiological signals such as heart rate, perspiration rate, and facial muscle contraction. Affective state was estimated using a twodimensional valence-arousal representation. A robot manipulator was used to generate motions expected during human–robot interaction, and human subjects were asked to report their response to these motions. The human physiological response was also measured. Robot motions were generated using both a nominal potential ﬁeld planner and a recently reported safe motion planner that minimizes the potential collision forces along the path. The robot motions were tested with 36 subjects. This data was used to train and validate the HMM model. The results of the HMM affective estimation are also compared to a previously implemented fuzzy inference engine.},

abstract={Emotion recognition based on affective physiological changes is a pattern recognition problem, and selecting specific physiological signals is necessary and helpful to recognize the emotions. Fingertip blood oxygen saturation (OXY), galvanic skin response (GSR) and heart rate (HR) are acquired while amusement, anger, grief and fear of 101 subjects are individually elicited by films. The affective physiological changes in multi-subject GSR, the first derivative of GSR (FD_GSR) and HR are detected by the multi-variant correlation method. The correlation analysis reveals that multi-subject HR, GSR and FD_GSR fluctuations respectively have common intra-class affective patterns. In addition to the conventional features of HR and GSR, the affective HR, GSR and FD_GSR fluctuations are quantified by the local scaling dimension and applied as the affective features. The multi-subject affective database containing 477 cases is classified by a Random Forests classifier. An overall correct rate of 74 percent for quinary classification of amusement, anger, grief, fear and the baseline state are obtained.},

Methods and results are presented for single-trial classiﬁcation of arousal, valence and like/dislike ratings using the modalities of EEG, peripheral physiological signals and multimedia content analysis. Finally, decision fusion of the classiﬁcation results from the different modalities is performed. The dataset is made publicly available and we encourage other researchers to use it for testing their own affective state estimation methods.},

	abstract = {Advanced metering devices (smart meters) are being installed throughout electric networks in Germany (as well as in other parts of Europe and in the United States). Unfortunately, smart meters are able to become surveillance devices that monitor the behavior of the customers. This leads to unprecedented invasions of consumer privacy. The highresolution energy consumption data which are transmitted to the utility company allow intrusive identiﬁcation and monitoring of equipment within consumers’ homes (e. g., TV set, refrigerator, toaster, and oven). Our research shows that the analysis of the household’s electricity usage proﬁle at a 0.5s−1 sample rate does reveal what channel the TV set in the household was displaying. It is also possible to identify (copyrightprotected) audiovisual content in the power proﬁle that is displayed on a CRT1, a Plasma display TV or a LCD2 television set with dynamic backlighting. Our test results indicate that a 5 minutes-chunk of consecutive viewing without major interference by other appliances is suﬃcient to identify the content.},

	abstract = {Goal: This paper reports on a novel algorithm for the analysis of electrodermal activity (EDA) using methods of convex optimization. EDA can be considered one of the most common observation channels of sympathetic nervous system activity, and manifests itself as a change in electrical properties of the skin, such as skin conductance (SC). Methods: The proposed model describes SC as the sum of three terms: the phasic component, the tonic component, and an additive white Gaussian noise term incorporating model prediction errors as well as measurement errors and artifacts. This model is physiologically inspired and fully explains EDA through a rigorous methodology based on Bayesian statistics, mathematical convex optimization and sparsity. Results: The algorithm was evaluated in three different experimental sessions to test its robustness to noise, its ability to separate and identify stimulus inputs, and its capability of properly describing the activity of the autonomic nervous system in response to strong affective stimulation. Signiﬁcance: Results are very encouraging, showing good performance of the proposed method and suggesting promising future applicability, e.g., in the ﬁeld of affective computing.},

EQ-Radio transmits an RF signal and analyzes its reﬂections oﬀ a person’s body to recognize his emotional state (happy, sad, etc.). The key enabler underlying EQ-Radio is a new algorithm for extracting the individual heartbeats from the wireless signal at an accuracy comparable to on-body ECG monitors. The resulting beats are then used to compute emotion-dependent features which feed a machine-learning emotion classiﬁer. We describe the design and implementation of EQ-Radio, and demonstrate through a user study that its emotion recognition accuracy is on par with stateof-the-art emotion recognition systems that require a person to be hooked to an ECG monitor.},

A powerful combination of factors is driving this change. These include rapid advances in mobile technologies and applications a rise in new opportunities for the integration of mobile health into existing eHealth services and the continued growth in coverage of mobile cellular networks. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) there are now over 5 billion wireless subscribers; over 70\% of them reside in low- and middle-income countries. The GSM Association reports commercial wireless signals cover over 85\% of the world's population extending far beyond the reach of the electrical grid. For the first time the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Observatory for eHealth (GOe) has sought to determine the status of mHealth in Member States; its 2009 global survey contained a section specifically devoted to mHealth. Completed by 114 Member States the survey documented for analysis four aspects of mHealth: adoption of initiatives types of initiatives status of evaluation and barriers to implementation.

Current research suggests that deep convolutional neural networks are suited to automate feature extraction from raw sensor inputs. However, human activities are made of complex sequences of motor movements, and capturing this temporal dynamics is fundamental for successful HAR. Based on the recent success of recurrent neural networks for time series domains, we propose a generic deep framework for activity recognition based on convolutional and LSTM recurrent units, which: (i) is suitable for multimodal wearable sensors; (ii) can perform sensor fusion naturally; (iii) does not require expert knowledge in designing features; and (iv) explicitly models the temporal dynamics of feature activations. We evaluate our framework on two datasets, one of which has been used in a public activity recognition challenge. Our results show that our framework outperforms competing deep non-recurrent networks on the challenge dataset by 4\% on average; outperforming some of the previous reported results by up to 9\%. Our results show that the framework can be applied to homogeneous sensor modalities, but can also fuse multimodal sensors to improve performance. We characterise key architectural hyperparameters’ inﬂuence on performance to provide insights about their optimisation.},

Using character-level language models as an interpretable testbed, we aim to bridge this gap by providing an analysis of their representations, predictions and error types. In particular, our experiments reveal the existence of interpretable cells that keep track of long-range dependencies such as line lengths, quotes and brackets. Moreover, our comparative analysis with ﬁnite horizon n-gram models traces the source of the LSTM improvements to long-range structural dependencies.

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	doi = {10.7717/peerj.6339},
	abstract = {One reason for the widespread success of random forests (RFs) is their ability to analyze most datasets without preprocessing. For example, in contrast to many other statistical methods and machine learning approaches, no recoding such as dummy coding is required to handle ordinal and nominal predictors. The standard approach for nominal predictors is to consider all 2k - 1 - 1 2-partitions of the k predictor categories. However, this exponential relationship produces a large number of potential splits to be evaluated, increasing computational complexity and restricting the possible number of categories in most implementations. For binary classiﬁcation and regression, it was shown that ordering the predictor categories in each split leads to exactly the same splits as the standard approach. This reduces computational complexity because only k - 1 splits have to be considered for a nominal predictor with k categories. For multiclass classiﬁcation and survival prediction no ordering method producing equivalent splits exists. We therefore propose to use a heuristic which orders the categories according to the ﬁrst principal component of the weighted covariance matrix in multiclass classiﬁcation and by log-rank scores in survival prediction. This ordering of categories can be done either in every split or a priori, that is, just once before growing the forest. With this approach, the nominal predictor can be treated as ordinal in the entire RF procedure, speeding up the computation and avoiding category limits. We compare the proposed methods with the standard approach, dummy coding and simply ignoring the nominal nature of the predictors in several simulation settings and on real data in terms of prediction performance and computational efﬁciency. We show that ordering the categories a priori is at least as good as the standard approach of considering all 2-partitions in all datasets considered, while being computationally faster. We recommend to use this approach as the default in RFs.},
