The advancement in wearable technology has enabled the devices to gather sensitive physiological data like Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Electrocardiogram (ECG) etc. This has opened new avenues into utilizing user’s physiological data to determine preferences and behavior of an individual. A study conducted by the Federal Trade Commission in 2014 looked at 12 different health apps and found they sent user information to 76 different third parties, such as ad networks and analytics firms. \cite{FTCStudy} The lack of security around health information raises several privacy concerns.

In this thesis, we try to determine if the physiological data of the user obtained from the wearable devices can be utilized to determine user’s viewing activity. We took into consideration 8 short movies. We collected ECG and EDA data of 20 subjects for those short movies. We then used several machine learning algorithms to determine if we can predict which movie the individual is watching.
